\title{Visualize reproductive investment across body sizes}
\usage{
plotReproSizeSpectra(mdl, n_years = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs with reproduction data}

\item{n_years}{The number of years (from the end) over which to average (default: 10)}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing reproductive rate vs body size by fish group
}
\description{
Creates plots showing how reproductive investment is distributed
across body sizes for fish functional groups.
}
\details{
Plot Reproduction Size Spectra

This function visualizes:
\itemize{
\item Reproductive rate as a function of body size
\item The effect of the maturity ogive on reproduction allocation
\item Size-dependent patterns in reproductive investment
}

The plot shows the specific reproductive rate (g reproduction / g body weight / time)
at each body size, averaged over the specified number of years.

\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model
results <- zoomss_model(input_params, Groups)
repro_size_plot <- plotReproSizeSpectra(results, n_years = 10)
