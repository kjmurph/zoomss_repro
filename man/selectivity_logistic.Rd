\title{Logistic Selectivity Function}
\usage{
selectivity_logistic(w, L50, L95)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{Numeric vector of body masses (or log10 body masses)}

\item{L50}{Numeric scalar, size at 50 percent selectivity (same scale as w)}

\item{L95}{Numeric scalar, size at 95 percent selectivity (same scale as w)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of selectivity values between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Internal helper function implementing logistic (sigmoid) selectivity curve.
Not exported - used internally by calc_selectivity.
}
\details{
Implements a logistic curve parameterized by two quantiles.
The coefficient log(19) ensures that selectivity equals 0.95 at L95
when it equals 0.5 at L50, following standard fisheries parameterization.

This produces a smooth S-shaped curve representing gradual increase in
vulnerability with size, typical of gillnets and hook-based gear.
