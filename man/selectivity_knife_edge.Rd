\title{Knife-Edge Selectivity Function}
\usage{
selectivity_knife_edge(w, w_min)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{Numeric vector of body masses (or log10 body masses)}

\item{w_min}{Numeric scalar, minimum vulnerable size (same scale as w)}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of selectivity values (0 or 1)
}
\description{
Internal helper function implementing knife-edge (step function) selectivity.
Not exported - used internally by calc_selectivity.
}
\details{
Implements a step function where selectivity is 0 for w less than w_min
(invulnerable) and 1 for w greater than or equal to w_min (fully vulnerable).
