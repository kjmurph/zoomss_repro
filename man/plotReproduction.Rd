\title{Visualize fish reproduction metrics through time}
\usage{
plotReproduction(mdl, by = "SSB", transform = "identity")
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs with reproduction data}

\item{by}{Character string specifying the metric to plot. Options:
"SSB" (Spawning Stock Biomass), "recruitment", "repro_output" (default: "SSB")}

\item{transform}{Character vector of the required y-axis transformation.
Options from \verb{scale_*_continuous} (Default: "identity")}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing the requested reproduction time series by fish group
}
\description{
Creates time series plots showing spawning stock biomass (SSB),
recruitment, and total reproductive output for fish functional groups.
}
\details{
Plot Reproduction Time Series

This function visualizes key fish reproduction metrics including:
\itemize{
\item \strong{SSB (Spawning Stock Biomass)}: Total biomass of mature individuals
\item \strong{Recruitment}: Number of new recruits entering the smallest size class
\item \strong{Reproductive Output}: Total reproductive investment (biomass allocated to reproduction)
}

These metrics are essential for understanding population dynamics driven by
the explicit energy budget and reproduction system.

\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model

# Plot different reproduction metrics
ssb_plot <- plotReproduction(results, by = "SSB")
recruitment_plot <- plotReproduction(results, by = "recruitment")
repro_plot <- plotReproduction(results, by = "repro_output")
