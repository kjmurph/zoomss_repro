\title{Visualize prey-specific assimilation efficiencies}
\usage{
plotAssimilationMatrix(mdl)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs and parameters}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing assimilation efficiency heatmap
}
\description{
Creates a heatmap showing the net assimilation efficiency
(accounting for both defecation and growth fraction) for each predator-prey
combination.

\details{
Plot Assimilation Efficiency Matrix

This function visualizes the assim_by_prey matrix which represents:
\deqn{assim_{pred,prey} = (1 - D_{prey}) \times K_{pred}}

This is the fraction of ingested prey biomass that contributes to predator
somatic growth, combining prey digestibility and predator growth efficiency.
