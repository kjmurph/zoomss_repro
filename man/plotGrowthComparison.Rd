\alias{plotGrowthComparison}
\title{Compare growth rates across functional groups}
\usage{
plotGrowthComparison(mdl, groups = "all", n_years = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs}

\item{groups}{Character string specifying which groups to plot.
Options: "fish", "zooplankton", "all" (default: "all")}

\item{n_years}{The number of years (from the end) over which to average (default: 10)}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing growth rate vs body size by group
}
\description{
Creates comparative plots of growth rates for fish and zooplankton
groups, useful for analyzing energy budget effects on growth.
}
\details{
Plot Growth Rate Comparison

This function visualizes growth rate patterns by:
\itemize{
\item Showing size-dependent growth rates for each group
\item Allowing comparison between zooplankton and fish groups
\item Highlighting differences due to energy budget parameterisation
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model
results <- zoomss_model(input_params, Groups)

# Compare growth rates
all_growth <- plotGrowthComparison(results, groups = "all")
fish_growth <- plotGrowthComparison(results, groups = "fish")
zoo_growth <- plotGrowthComparison(results, groups = "zooplankton")
}

}
