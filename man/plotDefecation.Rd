\title{Visualize prey-dependent defecation rates}
\usage{
plotDefecation(mdl)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{ZooMSS results object containing model outputs and parameters}
}
\value{
ggplot object showing defecation rate vs prey Carbon content
}
\description{
Creates a plot showing how defecation rates vary with prey Carbon
content, illustrating the continuous food quality scaling in the energy budget.
}
\details{
Plot Defecation Rates by Prey Type

This function visualizes the prey-dependent defecation rates calculated
using the formula:
\deqn{D_{prey} = D_{high} + (D_{low} - D_{high}) \times (1 - C_{prey}/C_{max})}

The plot shows:
\itemize{
\item Each prey group's Carbon content and resulting defecation fraction
\item The continuous relationship between Carbon and defecation
\item The defecation range (def_high to def_low)
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After running ZooMSS model
results <- zoomss_model(input_params, Groups)
defecation_plot <- plotDefecation(results)
}
